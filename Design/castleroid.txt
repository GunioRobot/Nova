--world--

the character and the world are inseperable.

the rooms are generated as soon as they are entered, then saved along
with the game progress. so in this way, the world is endless but remains
unique. there are themed rooms too and so it forms a heirarchy, not just
of rooms but of themed areas. the map is a grid by screen size. 4:3.

only if there are teleports: ?
the whole dungeon is saved, so monsters do not come back. and breakable
things stay broken if they were broken.

monsters actually respond after 1 minute or so after being killed.

there will need to be logic so that if a player needs an item to continue
from getting stuck, they can somehow get it. say if they are surrounded
with no health, by rooms that require health to pass, and another room
that needs a certain item to cross lava (or something), then ...
